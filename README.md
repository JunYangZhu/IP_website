CATNAP is an online pet store selling pet necessities, toys, and accessories. As a user, when you first enter our website, you will be able to see a home page of the new items and a discount code you can use. Users are able to search for the products they need using the dropdown menu which have the products sorted into categories. As a pet owner, users can find the products needed to give their pets a happy, healthy and fulfilling life. Users can also earn points when purchasing our products and increase their membership rank. This website works to not only allow pet owners to get pet necessities, but to allow them to earn 3D figurines and discounts as points are accumulated, aimed to let pet owners enjoy shopping for their pets by saving as much as possible and getting a small figurine for their collection. 

Design Process
Our main target for this website is obviously pet owners, to use our website to make purchases for their pets as they are our main users on this platform. We hope that our website will appeal to them and encourage them to use our website more as it is easy to use and accessible. We also hope that our 3D figurine collection and ranking up of the memberships, which gives users points, in turn allowing pet owners who purchase our items to get discounts and free shipping, which can hence entice more users to make purchases on their website so that they can collect more figurines. Hence, we chose to target free spirits as they would be users who want to use our website as they are pet owners who are looking to purchase pet accessories. 

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:

As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.
This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory) Include the Adobe XD wireframe as a folder. You can include the XD share url.

add special icons to make the website look more appealing

api - Restdb
used to store account information and cart information


You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

Buttons in cart page doesnt work, buttons of default item in cart page works well, console.log() works, but buttons of items generated from cartList() does not work even though classes are exactly the same

recently viewed storage doesnt work, added to localStorage and console.log does show it was added to localStorage but when calling it again right after console the localStorage is empty

Api limitations, limitations make it hard to test and when requests can't be made anymore, i have to stop testing and edit the codes by guess and prepare it for furture testing

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.
